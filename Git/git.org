  1. Create a new repository
     Do not initizalize the new repository with README, license, or
     gitignore.
  2. Open Terminal
  3. cd to local dir (that you want to put on github)
  4. $ git innit
  5. Add the files in your new local repository.  This stages them for commit
     $ git add .
     # Adds the files in the local repo and stages them for commit.
     # To unstage a file, use git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE
  6. Commit the files you have staged in your local repo.
     $ get commit -m "First commit"
     # Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to the pushed to
     # a remore repo.  To remove this commit and modify the file, use
     # git reset --soft HEAD~1 and commit and add the file again
  7. At the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click
     to copy the remote repository URL
  8. In terminal, add the URL for the remove repo where your local
     repository will be pushed.
     $ git remote add origin <remove repository URL>
     # sets the new remote
     $ git remote -v
     # verifies the new remote URL
  9. Push the changes in your local repo to GitHub
     $ git push origin master
     # Pushes the changes in your local repo up to the
     # remote repo you specified as the origin
* .gitignore
  .gitignore
  *~
* git add -all
  This will add all files that have not been staged.
  This is kind of dangerous because it looks at the git root parent
  directory, irrespective of where you call it from.
* git add -all :/
  recursively add the entire tree structure of the folder
* git add *
  luckily this will ignore the files you have specified
* git reset
  This will unstage the add -all done above
* git rm -r --cached .
  recursively remove everything added
* git add -n .
* Much more complex "undo" of staging

* git commit
  Commit any changes you have made
* git push origin master
  where origin is set by
* git remote add origin https://github.com/frankieliu/sicp
* git push origin master
